# Power BI Dashboard on GitHub Pages

This is a simple HTML page to embed a Power BI dashboard using GitHub Pages.

## Steps:

1. Publish your Power BI report to the Power BI service.
2. Get the **embed link** from the Power BI report.
3. Paste the link in the `index.html` file where it says `YOUR_POWER_BI_EMBED_LINK`.
4. Upload the files to GitHub.
5. Enable **GitHub Pages** in the repository settings.

Now you can view your Power BI dashboard publicly via GitHub Pages.

## Notes:

- The report is publicly accessible using the "Publish to Web" method in Power BI, so make sure your data doesn't contain any sensitive or confidential information.
